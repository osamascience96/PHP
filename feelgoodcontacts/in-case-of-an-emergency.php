				<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
				<p class="prescription_txt">First and foremost, if your eyes suddenly become irritated you must not panic and frantically start rubbing your eyes, as this is more likely to aggravate the condition. Assess if the situation at hand is a true emergency? It may be that the lens is the cause and can be remedied by removing it. If the eyes still feel uncomfortable after removing the lenses and the symptoms of pain and/or redness persists, medical attention should be sought urgently.</p>
				
				<p class="prescription_txt">We have listed a few common reasons why lens wearers may experience sudden discomfort but, of course, there are many more</p>
				
				<h5>Non-Emergencies</h5>
				
				<p class="prescription_txt">Accidents happen with contact lenses and you may find that your lenses can tear while you are trying to remove them. This can result in a fragment of contact lens stuck in the eye, however, you can be rest assured that there is no such thing as a lost contact lens and there are ways to locate and successfully remove it.</p>
				
				<p><b>What does a torn contact lens feel like?</b></p>
				<p class="prescription_txt">A torn piece of contact lens stuck in the eye will often be uncomfortable. Torn or damaged lenses can also interrupt your vision. If you get a piece of torn contact lens in the eye, this should be removed quickly to prevent any further discomfort.</p>
				
				<p><b>Can a ripped contact lens hurt your eye?</b></p>
				<p class="prescription_txt">A ripped contact lens can hurt your eye, especially if not taken care of. It is not safe to wear a torn lens as the jagged edges can scratch the surface of your cornea. If you've worn the torn lens, make sure you see an optician. There’s no need to worry though, as torn contact lenses are rare and become even more unlikely as you get used to contact lenses. All you need to do is follow a few simple steps as an effective safety procedure to remove the broken lens from your eye. These steps will show you how you can get a broken contact lens out of your eye without panic.</p>
				
				<p class="prescription_txt">The first thing to do when going to remove a contact lens stuck in your eye is make sure you wash your hands. This should in fact be the first step in any eye care routine in order to prevent bacteria reaching the surface of your eye as this can lead to infections.Apply some rewetting drops to your eyes – these eye drops will moisten your eye and make it easier for you to remove the pieces of the lens. Try and blink to move the pieces of contact lens to the corner of your eye. Gently massage the lower and upper eyelids until you feel the pieces have come loose. After you massage your eyelid, carefully turn your eyelid inside out and remove the lens fragments that are attached. Rinse your eyes with a saline or multipurpose solution to ensure hygiene.</p>
				
				<p class="prescription_txt">You can repeat these steps until you’re confident all of the contact lens has been removed. If, after a few tries, you’ve been unsuccessful, it’s best to visit your optician as soon as possible. Rigid gas permeable lenses are unlikely to tear due to their durable nature, however if you get a gas permeable contact lens stuck in your eye, you should not follow the above procedure as this can damage the eye. Instead seek help from an optician immediately.</p>
