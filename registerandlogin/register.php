//1#We are using a respected password hashing
//algorithm called BCRYPT. Other login tutorials
//make the mistake of promoting hashing
//algorithms such as md5 and sha1. The problem
//with md5 and sha1 is that they are “too fast”,
//which basically means that password crackers
//can “break them” at a much quicker rate.

//2#You will need to add your own error checking
//to this registration form (username length,
//what type of characters are allowed, etc).
//You will also need to implement your own
//method of handling user errors as the code
//above is pretty basic in that respect.
//For further help on this subject, be sure
//to check out my tutorial on handling form
//errors in PHP.

//3#If the insert code above looks completely
//foreign to you, then you should probably
//check out my article on Inserts with PDO.
